**Hi there! My name is Alexandra, and I‚Äôm currently entering my second year at Dominican University, where I‚Äôm majoring in Nursing. I work as a CNA and am especially interested in pursuing a nursing specialty in oncology, which is why I chose to explore cancer data in this project. I took this data science course to challenge myself and explore the world of R and computer science‚Äîand I‚Äôve genuinely enjoyed learning how to analyze and visualize real-world health data.**

**Outside of school and work, I find joy in nature and spend as much time outdoors as I can. I also love hanging out with my family, my sweet dog, and my boyfriend of three years. And yes... I *do* have a soft spot for raccoons ü¶ù.**
