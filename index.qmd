# Benign and Malignant Cancer Data

-   **Introduction**

    -   Cancer is one of the leading causes of death globally. I'm interested in exploring how different variables—such as age, tumor size, or metastasis presence—relate to whether a cancer case is benign or malignant.

    -   Questions: Are there specific features (like radius or texture) that predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign?

    -   This matters to me because early prediction of malignancy could help in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

    -   Predictions: I predict that larger tumor sizes (measured by radius_mean and area_mean) will strongly correlate with a higher chance of a tumor being malignant.

    -   Specifically, I expect that:

        -   Malignant tumors will have at least a 30% higher average radius than benign tumors.

        -   There will be a clear separation in the boxplot or density curves.

    -   Data Source I will be using: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/erdemtaha/cancer-data?resource=download>

-   **Approach**

    -   Data set details:

        -   Source: Kaggle – Cancer Data (UCI Machine Learning Repository version)

        -   How data was collected: Digitized features of a breast mass from fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast tissue.

        -   Variables include:

            -   'diagnosis': malignant (M) or Benign (B)

            -   Several numeric variables like 'radius_mean,' 'area_mean,' 'texture_mean,' etc.

        -   There are 569 rows.

        -   There are 33 variables

    -   **Tools**

        -   Tools I am using are R and RStudio in Posit Cloud, GitHub for website hosting, and packages like 'tidyverse' and 'ggplot2.'

    -   **Approach/Predictions**

        -   I will examine how radius_mean and area_mean relate to diagnosis.

        -   Specifically:

            -   Do malignant tumors have a higher radius_mean than benign ones?

            -   Do area and texture also show visual differences across diagnosis types?

        -   Predictions (Revisited)

            -   Malignant tumors will have a median radius at least 2 mm larger than benign ones.
            -   A boxplot will show a clear separation in radius distributions.

-   **Results:**

```{r}

mydata <- read.csv("Cancer_Data.csv")

mydata <- mydata %>%
  mutate(diagnosis = recode(diagnosis,
                            "B" = "Benign",
                            "M" = "Malignant"))
ggplot(mydata, aes(x = diagnosis, y = radius_mean, fill = diagnosis, diagnosis = "B" == "Benign")) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Tumor Radius by Diagnosis Type",
    x = "Diagnosis",
    y = "Median Radius (mm)",
  )
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| include: false
         
# mydata <- mydata %>%
#   mutate(diagnosis = recode(diagnosis,
#                             "B" = "Benign",
#                             "M" = "Malignant"))
# ggplot(mydata, aes(x = diagnosis, y = texture_mean, fill = diagnosis)) + geom_boxplot() + 
#   labs(
#     title = "Tumor Texture by Diagnosis Type",
#     x = "Diagnosis",
#     y = "Mean Texture (mm)"
#   )
# 
# mydata <- mydata %>%
#   mutate(diagnosis = recode(diagnosis,
#                             "B" = "Benign",
#                             "M" = "Malignant"))
# ggplot(mydata, aes(x = diagnosis, y = area_mean, fill = diagnosis)) + 
#   geom_boxplot() + 
#   labs(
#     title = "Tumor Area by Diagnosis Type",
#     x = "Diagnosis",
#     y = "Mean Area (mm)"
#   )
```

-   **Figure Caption:**

This figure shows the distribution of tumor radii for benign and malignant diagnoses. Malignant tumors tend to have higher radius measurements.

-   **Conclusion:**

Malignant tumors tend to have larger radii than benign ones, with minimal overlap in distribution.

-   **Discussion**

    -   My hypothesis was supported. I expected malignant tumors to have significantly larger radii, and the data showed exactly that.

    -   I now believe more strongly that certain tumor features are reliable predictors of malignancy.

    -   I could improve this analysis by:

        \- Including a logistic regression model

        \- Exploring more features simultaneously
